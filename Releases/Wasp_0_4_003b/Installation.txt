+++++++++++++++ For Rhino5 users only +++++++++++++++
Wasp is written in Python, and hence requires the GhPython addon to be already installed in your Grasshopper folder.

GhPython installation
- If you do not have GhPython installed, download it from Food4Rhino: www.food4rhino.com/app/ghpython
- Copy the .gha file in the Grasshopper libraries folder (File -> Special folders -> Libraries)
- Right click on the copied file, go to properties and make sure the file is not blocked.
- Reload Grasshopper and under Math/Scripts you should have a new Python component.
