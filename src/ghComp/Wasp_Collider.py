"""
Generate a collider for a given geometry.
-
Provided by Wasp 0.5
    Args:
        GEO: Geometry of the collider(s)
        MUL: OPTIONAL // Set to True if you are using multiple colliders and it is sufficient for one of them not to collide (False by default)
        ALL: OPTIONAL // If MUL is set to True, set to True to check all colliders (False by default, search will stop after finding a valid collider)
        CONN: OPTIONAL // If MUL is set to True, associate a connection to each collider (e.g. a picking position for the tool collider).
    Returns:
        COLL: Collider instance
